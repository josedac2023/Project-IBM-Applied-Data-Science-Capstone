ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone project is the tenth and final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It aims to integrate and apply all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the specialization in a real-world scenario.

ðŸ“„ Project Background
SpaceX has established itself as the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel more affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers who charge upwards of $165 million per launch. Much of these savings come from SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the rocketâ€™s first stage. Therefore, if we can predict whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the true cost of a launch. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, this project aims to predict whether SpaceX will be able to reuse the first stage.

ðŸ“„ Research Questions
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit affect the success of the first stage landing?

Has the rate of successful landings improved over the years?

Which binary classification algorithm performs best for this prediction task?

ðŸ“„ Methodology
1. Data Collection
Extracting data using the SpaceX REST API.

Web scraping relevant information from Wikipedia.

2. Data Wrangling
Filtering and selecting relevant features.

Handling missing values.

Applying One Hot Encoding to prepare data for binary classification.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducting descriptive analysis and visualizations using Python and SQL.

4. Interactive Visual Analytics
Developing interactive maps and dashboards with Folium and Plotly Dash to explore spatial and temporal patterns.

5. Predictive Modeling
Building, tuning, and evaluating classification models to predict first stage landing success.

Comparing multiple algorithms to identify the most accurate and robust model.
